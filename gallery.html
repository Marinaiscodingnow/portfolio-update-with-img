        <h4>Study website</h4>
        <p>This was my first website that wasn't practice. I wanted to make a website that I could use to study for my classes.
          I believe if I had more time I could make it even better, but I truly enjoy how it came out.</p>

        <h4>Web Design Website</h4>
        <p>This website was based on the Web Design Program at my school. I took some of the photos on my phone from the actual 
          class, and really enjoyed designing the website and making it so interactive.</p>

        <h4>Holiday Card</h4>
        <p>I made the holiday card by combining two tutorials I saw and changing certain aspects of them. With every tutorial I use
          I try to make them my own. The holiday card was super fun to make and design.</p>

          <h4>Little Bird Toy Store</h4>
          <p>This website was a mock-up of a toy store and it came out pretty well, while there are a few kinks in the code,
            All the details and design elements really came together beautifully.</p>

          <h4>Education Website </h4>
          <p>This website was created by me and 3 other begginer coders. We met at a Hackathon in our community and created a protoype of
            the website we wanted to make. It was such a nice expirence.</p>

          <h4>Website-replica</h4>
          <p>This website was super fun to make since I was copying off of another brand.
            I thought the website was cool but challenging enough for the assignment. I am extremely proud of how it came out.</p>

          <h4>AJR Wireframe</h4>
          <p>This is the wire frame for a website I had wanted to create based on a band named AJR, I love the design elements,
            and wish I had time to actually turn this into a working website.</p>

        <h4>Sci-Fi</h4>
        <p>I used photoshop to create a sci-fi scene,  creating the shapes and lighting around the subject, giving a very mysterious atmosphere and
          illuminating her.</p>

        <h4>Harry Potter</h4>
        <p>One of my favorite books is Harry Potter, so I had a lot of fun creating one of my favorite story book characters. Harry

        <h4>Pink Lady</h4>
        <p>I took quite a bit of creative liberty with this project, changing the tint to the charcter and adding ink prints to
          highlight the character. </p>

        <p>I took this shot by using my phones flashlight, to make the sun rising. I thought that it looked so interesting with the light
